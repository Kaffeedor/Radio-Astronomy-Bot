# Radio Astronomy Bot
Radio Astronomy Bot is a Discord Bot with powerful Moderation tools and some neat Radio Astronomy commands.
There is also the Fedor's Telescope Bot which controls my Radio Telescope.
Fedor's Telescope Bot is powered with [VIRGO](https://github.com/0xCoto/VIRGO) by [0xCoto](https://github.com/0xCoto).
This bot is maintained and is operational on the [Radio Astronomy and Space](https://disboard.org/server/657857708644499458) Discord Server.

### Disclaimer: Bot Optimized for a Specific Server ([Radio Astronomy and Space](https://disboard.org/server/657857708644499458)):
This Bot *WILL NOT WORK* if you just copy the code and change the Token! You need to change the Roles and Channels to make it work!

#### Calc Command is Currently Disabled due to Security Issues, It is No Longer an Issue and Will Be Fixed Later
